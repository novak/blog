I'm going to describe some things here, using some code and some embeds to test out all the layout for my new blog site.

<!--more-->

This is some more text that will take up some more space to see where the actual summary ends and the real post will end up
beginning.

First things first, here's some code.

```java
public class HelloWorld extends Greeting {
    @Override
    public String greet() {
        return "Hello, world!";
    }
}
```

If you think that is cool, just wait until you see what it is in Swift. Another great programming language.

```swift
class StatsViewController: UIViewController {
    override func loadView() {
        return StatsView()
    }
}
```

Swift code is pretty cool, but TypeScript is also cool. Luckily with the formatting options I can do that too. You can have
lots of different languages and it is all syntax highlighted.

What kind of code do you write and what do you think of it? Is it something you'd publish online or something you'd bury
away so that no one can see what you have written?

Then the blog post just keeps going along after special formatting that we have going on here. Especially with the fun
new way of doing nothing that everyone is talking about all the time.
